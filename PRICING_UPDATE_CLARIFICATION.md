**For ALL future purchases:**
- ✅ **NO manual work needed!**
- ✅ Subscriptions will be created **automatically**
- ✅ They'll appear in admin dashboard **automatically**
- ✅ Everything works **automatically** after payment

## 🔄 **HOW IT WORKS NOW**

### **For Future Purchases (Automatic):**

1. **User clicks "Purchase Plan"**
   - Sees correct price: KSh 600, 1,350, or 4,000
   
2. **Payment processed via Paystack**
   - Correct amount charged in KES
   - Payment successful
   
3. **Webhook automatically fires**
   - Paystack sends webhook to backend
   - Backend verifies payment
   - **Subscription created automatically in Firestore**
   - **Admin dashboard updated automatically**
   
4. **User sees subscription active**
   - Tokens available immediately
   - Plan shows in their account
   - No manual work needed!

### **For Your Previous Purchase (One-Time Manual Fix):**

Since that payment already happened but subscription wasn't created, you need to:

1. **Go to Firebase Console**
2. **Manually create the subscription document** (one time only)
3. **Done!** You'll have your tokens

**This is ONLY for that one purchase. All future purchases work automatically!**
