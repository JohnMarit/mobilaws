**Note-***Money or any other property as well may be ordered as compensation under this section. See the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, 2008\.

**25\. Act done by Person Bound or Justified by Law.** 

No act is an offence which is done by a person who is legally bound to do it or justified by law in doing it, or who by reason of a mistake of fact, and not by reason of a mistake of law in good faith believes himself or herself to be bound by law to do it or justified by law in doing it.

34   
**Act 9** *Penal Code Act* **200826\. Act of a Court.** 

No act is an offence which is committed by a person when acting judicially as a Court or as a member of a Court in the exercise of any power which is in good faith he or she believes to be given to him or her by law. 

**27\. Act Committed Pursuant to the Judgment or Order of the Court.** 

No act is an offence which is committed in pursuance of, or which is warranted by, the judgment or order of a Court, or for the execution of such judgment or order, if done whilst such judgment or order remains in force, notwithstanding that the Court may have had no jurisdiction to pass such judgment or order; provided that, the person doing the act believes, in good faith, that the Court has proper jurisdiction. 

**28\. Accident in Committing a Lawful Act.** 

No act is an offence which is committed by accident or misfortune and without any criminal intention or knowledge in the doing of a lawful act in a lawful manner by lawful means and with due care and attention. 

**29\. Act Committed to Prevent Injury.**  

No act is an offence by reason of any injury which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause, or be known by the doer to be likely to cause, if such act was committed without any criminal intent to cause injury, and in good faith for the purpose of preventing or avoiding other injury to person or property, or of benefiting the person to whom injury is or may be caused, provided that— 

(a) in the light of the circumstances of the case, the commission of the act was reasonable; 

(b) where the circumstances so require, the act was committed with reasonable care and skill; 

35   
**Act 9** *Penal Code Act* **2008**

(e) pecuniary benefit is not deemed to be a benefit within the meaning of this section. 

**Illustrations—** 

*(a) A passenger train traveling at a high speed is approaching a stationary passenger train upon the same line of rails. A railway employee, as the only means of preventing a collision that would probably involve the lives of many passengers, switches the moving train in to a siding.

*(b) “A” in a great fire pulls down houses in order to prevent the conflagration from spreading. “A” does this with the intention in good faith of saving human life or property. If, in light of the circumstances his or her acts are found to be reasonable, “A” is not guilty of an offence.* 

*(c) “Z” is seized by a crocodile, “A” fires at the crocodile knowing it to be likely that the shot may kill “Z” but not intending to kill “Z” and in good faith intending “Z’s” benefit. In fact “A” kills “Z”. “A” has committed no offence.*

**Illustrations—** 

*(a) “Z” under the influence of madness attempts to kill “A”. “Z” is guilty of no offence. But “A” has the same right of private defence which he would have if “Z” were sane; (b) “A” enters by night a house which he or she is legally entitled to enter. “Z” in good faith taking “A” for a house breaker, attacks “A” Here “Z”, by attacking “A” under this misconception, commits no offence.

**Act 9** *Penal Code Act* **2008CHAPTER IV** 

**JOINT ACTS, ABETMENT, CONSPIRACY AND ATTEMPT**  *Joint Acts* 

**48\. Acts Committed by Several Persons in Furtherance of Common Intention.**  

When a criminal act is committed by more than one person in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were committed by him or her alone**.** 

**49\. When such an Act is Criminal by Reason of its Being Committed With a Criminal Knowledge or Intent.** 

Whenever an act, which is criminal by reason of its being committed with a criminal knowledge or intent, is committed by more than one person, each of such persons who joins in the act, with such knowledge or intention, is liable for the act in the same manner as if the act were committed by him or her alone with that knowledge or intent. 

**50\. Cooperation by Committing One of Several Acts Constituting an Offence.** 

When an offence is committed by means of several acts, whoever intentionally cooperates in the commission of that offence by committing any one or more of those acts, either separately or jointly with any other person, commits that offence. 

**Illustrations**— 

*(a) “A” and “B” agree to murder “Z” by separately and at different times giving him small doses of poison.* 

43   
**Act 9** *Penal Code Act* **2008**

*“A” and “B” both administer the poison according to the agreement with intent to murder “Z”. “Z” dies from the effect of the several doses of poison so administered to him or her. Under these facts, “A” and “B” intentionally cooperate in the commission of murder and, as each of them does one or more of the several acts by which death is caused, they are both guilty of the offence, though their acts are separate and though the acts of one without the acts of the other would not have caused death.* 

*(b) “A” and “B” are joint jailors and each has charge of “Z”, a prisoner alternately for six hours at a time. “A” and “B”, intending to cause “Z’s”’ death, knowingly cooperate, by illegally omitting to furnish “Z” with food supplied to them for that purpose during the time of their respective attendance. “Z” dies of hunger. Both “A” and “B” are guilty of the murder of “Z”.* 

*(c) “A” a jailor has the charge of “Z” a prisoner. “A” intending to cause “Z’s” death illegally omits to supply “Z” with food. As a consequence, “Z” is significantly weaker, but still alive. “A” is dismissed from his or her office and “B” succeeds him or her.* 

*“B” without collusion or cooperation with “A” illegally omits to supply “Z” with food, knowing that he or she will probably cause “Z’s” death. “Z” dies of hunger. “B” is guilty of murder; but as “A” did not cooperate with “B” “A” is guilty only of an attempt to commit murder.* 

**51**. **Persons Concerned in Criminal Act May be Guilty of Different Offences.** 

Where more than one person is engaged or concerned in the commission of an offence, each may be guilty of a different offence depending on their individual actions.  

44   
**Act 9** *Penal Code Act* **2008Illustration—** 

*“Z” is attacked by “A”, under such circumstances of grave provocation that “A” killing of “Z” would only be culpable homicide, and not murder. “B”, having ill will towards “Z” intending to kill him or her and not having been subject to the provocation, assists “A” in killing “Z”**.** Under these facts, although both “A” and “B” are engaged in causing* 

*“Z’s” death, “B” is guilty of murder and “A” is guilty only of culpable homicide not amounting to murder.* 

*Abetment* 

**52\. Abetment.** 

(1) A person abets the commission of an act when he or she— (a) instigates another person to commit such act;  

(b) engages in a conspiracy with one or more other persons in the commission of the act; and/or,  

(c) intentionally aids or facilitates any act or illegal omission in the commission of the act. 

(2) A person abets an offence when such person abets either the commission of an offence, or the commission of an act which would be an offence, if committed with the same intention or knowledge as that of the abettor by a person capable by law of committing the offence. 

(3) It is not necessary that the person abetting should be capable by law of committing an offence or that he or she should have the same guilty intention or knowledge as that of the abettor, or any guilty intention or knowledge. 

**Explanation 1—** 

*A person who by willful misrepresentation or by willful concealment of a material fact which he or she is bound to disclose, voluntarily causes or procures or attempts to cause or procure the commission of an act, instigates the commission of such act within the meaning of this Chapter.* 

45   
**Act 9** *Penal Code Act* **2008Illustrations—** 

*(a) “A” is authorised by a warrant issued by a Court to arrest “Z”. “B”, knowing that fact and also that “C” is not “Z” willfully represents to “A” that “C” is “Z” and thereby intentionally causes “A” to arrest “C”. Under these facts, “B” abets by instigating the arrest of “C”.* 

*(b) “A”, a policeman, bound as such to give information of all designs to commit robbery, and knowing that “Z” intends to commit a robbery, illegally omits to give information of “Z’s” intention, knowing that the commission of the robbery is likely to be thereby facilitated. Under these facts, “A” has abetted the robbery.* 

**Explanation 2—** 

*(a) the abatement of the illegal omission of an act, may amount to an offence although the abettor may not himself or herself be bound to do that act.* 

*(b) to constitute the offence of abetment, it is not necessary that the act abetted should be committed or that the effect requisite to constitute the offence should be caused.* 

**Illustrations—** 

*(a) “A” instigates “B” to murder “C”. “B” refuses to do so, “A” is guilty of abetting “B” to commit murder.* 

*(b) “A” instigates “B” to murder “D”.“B” in pursuance of the instigation stabs “D”. “D” recovers from the wound. “A” is guilty of instigating “B” to commit murder;* 

*(c) “A”, with a guilty intention, abets a child or a lunatic in committing an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing an offence and having the same intention as “A”.* 

*Under these facts, “A”, whether the act be committed or not, is guilty of abetting an offence.* 

46   
**Act 9** *Penal Code Act* **2008**

*(d) “A”, intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates “B” to take property belonging to “Z” out of “Z’s” possession. “A” induces “B” to believe that the* 

*property belongs to “A”. “B” takes the property out of “Z’s” possession in good faith believing it to be “A’s” property. “B”, acting under this misconception does not take dishonestly and therefore does not commit theft. But “A” is guilty of abetting theft and is liable to the same punishment as if “B” had committed theft.* 

**Explanation 3—** 

*It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by conspiracy that the abettor engages in the offence with the person who commits it. It is sufficient if he or she engages in the conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed.* 

**Illustration—** 

*“A” and “B” create a plan for poisoning “Z”. It is agreed that “A” shall administer the poison. “B” then explains the plan to “C” mentioning that a third person is to administer the poison but without mentioning “A’s” name. “C” agrees to procure the* 

*poison, procures and delivers it to “B” for the purpose of its being used in the manner explained. “A” administers the poison; “Z” dies in consequence. Under these facts, though “A” and “C” have not conspired together, “C” has been engaged in the conspiracy in pursuance of which “Z” has been murdered. “C” has therefore committed the offence defined in this section and is liable to the punishment for murder.* 

**53\. Abetment if the Act Abetted is Committed in Consequence and where no Expressed Provision is made for Sentencing**. 

If the act abetted is committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Act or by any other law for the conviction of such abetment, whoever abets the offence shall be sentenced in accordance with the same provisions that apply to the commission of the offence.  

47   
**Act 9** *Penal Code Act* **2008Explanation—** 

*An act or offence is said to be committed in consequence of abetment, when it is committed in consequence of the instigation or in pursuance of the conspiracy or with the aid which constitutes the abetment.* 

**Illustrations—** 

*(a) “A” instigates “B” to give false evidence. “B” in consequence of the instigation commits that offence. “A” is guilty of abetting that offence and is liable to the same punishment as “B”.* 

*(b) “A” and “B” conspire to poison “Z”. “A” in pursuance of the conspiracy procures the poison and delivers it to “B” in order that he or she may administer it to “Z”. “B” in pursuance of the conspiracy administers the poison to “Z” in “A’s” absence and thereby causes “Z’s” death. Under these facts, “B” is guilty of murder. “A” is guilty of abetting that offence by conspiracy and is liable to the punishment for murder.* 

**54\. Abetment if a Person Abetted Commits the Act with Different Intention from that of the Abettor.**  

Whoever abets the commission of an offence shall, if the person abetted does the act with a different intention or knowledge from that of the abettor, upon conviction, shall be sentenced in accordance with the same provision that apply to the offence which would have been committed if the act had been done with the intention or knowledge of the abettor and with no other. 

**55\. Liability of Abettor when one act Abetted and Different Act Committed.**  

When an act is abetted and a different act is committed, the abettor is liable for the act committed in the same manner and to the same extent as if he or she had directly abetted it; provided that, the act committed was a probable consequence of the 48   
**Act 9** *Penal Code Act* **2008**

abetment, and was committed under the influence of the instigation or in pursuance of the conspiracy or with the aid which constituted the abetment. 

**Illustrations—** 

*(a) “A” instigates a child to put poison into the food of “Z” and gives him poison for that purpose. The child, in consequence of the instigation, by mistake puts the poison into the food of “Y”, which is by the side of that of “Z”. Here, if the child was acting under the influence of “A’s” instigation, and the act committed was in the circumstances a probable consequence of the abetment, “A” is liable in the same manner and to the same extent as if he or she had instigated the child to put the poison into the food of “Y”.* 

*(b) “A” instigates “B” and “C” to break into an inhabited house at midnight for the purpose of robbery, and provided them with arms for that purpose. “B” and “C” break into the house and being resisted by “Z”, either “B” or “C”, murder “Z”. Under these facts, if that murder was the probable consequence of the abetment, “A” is liable to the punishment for murder.* 

**56\. Abettor when Liable to Cumulative Sentences for act Abetted and for act Committed.** 

If the act for which the abettor is liable under section 55 above, is committed in addition to the act abetted, and such act constitutes a distinct offence, the abettor is liable to sentencing for each of the offences. 

**57\. Liability of Abettor for an effect caused by the act Abetted different from that Intended by the Abettor.** 

When an act is abetted with the intention on the part of the abettor of causing a particular effect, and the act is committed in a different way from that intended by the abettor, the abettor is liable for the effect caused in the same manner and to the same extent as if he or she had abetted the act with the intention of causing that effect; provided that, he or she knew that the act abetted was likely to cause that effect. 

49   
**Act 9** *Penal Code Act* **2008Exception—** 

*The abettor shall not be liable under this section to the punishment for murder unless he or she knew that death would be the probable consequence of the act abetted.* 

**Note-** *See section 210 of this Act.* 

**Illustration—** 

*“A” instigates “B” to cause grievous hurt to “Z”. “B” in consequence of the instigation causes grievous hurt to “Z”. “Z” dies in consequence. Under these facts,, if “A” knew that the grievous hurt abetted was likely to cause death, “A” is liable to be punished with the punishment provided* 

*for culpable homicide not amounting to murder or for murder as the case may be*. 

**58\. Abettor Present when an Offence is Committed Liable as a Principal.** 

Whenever any person who if absent would be liable to be convicted as an abettor, is present when the act or offence for which he or she would be sentenced in consequence of the abetment is committed, he or she shall be deemed to have committed such act or offence. 

**59\. Abetment of Offence Subject to Death Sentence or Life Imprisonment if the Offence is not Committed.**  

(1) Whoever abets the commission of an offence which may result in the death sentence or imprisonment, shall, if that offence is not committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Act or by any other law for the sentencing of such abetment, upon conviction be sentenced to imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years or with a fine or with both.  

50   
**Act 9** *Penal Code Act* **2008**

(2) If the abettor is a public servant whose duty is to prevent the commission of such offence, he or she shall be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years or with a fine or with both.  

**Illustration—** 

*“A” instigates “B” to murder “Z”. The offence is not committed. If “B” had murdered “Z” “B” would have been liable to the punishment of death. Therefore “A” is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years or, if he or she is a public servant whose duty it is to prevent the murder, for a term not exceeding ten years and also in any event to a fine*. 

**60\. Abetment of Offence Subject to Sentence of Imprisonment if Offence is not Committed.**  

(1) Whoever abets an offence, subject to the sentence of imprisonment, if that offence is not committed in consequence of the abetment and no express provision is made by this Act or by any other law for the conviction of such abetment, upon conviction, shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one-fourth of the longest term provided for that offence or with a fine or with both. 

(2) If the abettor is a public servant whose duty is to prevent the commission of such offence, he or she, upon conviction, shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one-half of the longest term provided for that offence or with such time as is provided for the offence or with a fine or with both. 

**Illustration—** 

*“A”, a policeman whose duty is to prevent robbery, abets the commission of robbery. Under these facts, though the robbery be not committed, “A” is liable to one-half of the longest term of imprisonment provided for that offence and also to a fine.* 

51   
**Act 9** *Penal Code Act* **2008**

**61\. Abetting Commission of Offence by the Public, or by more than Ten Persons.** 

Whoever abets the commission of an offence by the public generally, or by any number or class of persons exceeding ten, commits an offence, and upon conviction, shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years or with a fine or with both.

(2) Whoever is a party to a criminal conspiracy and, where there is no express provision for conviction in this Act, shall be sentenced in the same manner as if he or she had abetted such an offence. 

*Attempt*  

**63\. Attempting to Commit Offences Punishable with Imprisonment.**

52   
**Act 9** *Penal Code Act* **2008Illustrations—** 

*(a) “A” makes an attempt to steal some jewels by breaking open a box and finds on opening the box that there are no jewels in it. “A” has committed an act in furtherance of the commission of theft and therefore is guilty under this section.* 

*(b) “A” makes an attempt to pick the pocket of “Z” by thrusting his or her hand into “Z’s” pocket. “A” fails in the attempt to pick the pocket of “Z”, because “Z” has nothing in his or her pocket. “A” is guilty under this section.*
