## Responsible Disclosure Policy

We follow a responsible disclosure policy:
- We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- We will investigate and validate the vulnerability
- We will work to fix critical vulnerabilities within 30 days
- We will credit you for the discovery (if you wish)

## Scope

## Recognition

We appreciate the security research community and will publicly acknowledge researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities (with their permission).

## Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers who:

- Report vulnerabilities promptly

We will not pursue legal action against researchers who follow these guidelines.
